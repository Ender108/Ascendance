# Introduction
Ascendance is a Simonrim modlist for Skyrim. The goal of Ascendance is to improve gameplay in a challenging yet rewarding way using Simon Magus' series of overhauls, while staying true to the core Skyrim experience. Ascendance also includes a noticeable visual upgrade while still maintaining very high performance. 

# Modlist Features
- Simon Magus' suite of gameplay overhauls (Mysticism, Adamant, Apothecary, Thaumaturgy...).
- Enemy overhauls such as Dragon War, The Dragon Cult, Lawless, Madmen, Hokoron, and King-Priest.
- Integration and balancing of Creations from the paid Anniversary Edition update.
- Very low performance impact due to using the Community Shaders suite by Doodlum (Grass Lighting, TAA Deblur, Grass Sampling...).

# Requirements
- The latest version (currently 1.6.1170.0 for Steam) of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. The GoG version of Skyrim is NOT supported.
- All Creations from the paid Anniversary Edition update.
- Note: This list does NOT require any of the Creations (aka Paid Mods) from the December 2023 update.

# Recommended Specs
- CPU: Quad-core processor with high single core performance (4.0GHz or more).
- RAM: 16 GB of DDR4 memory.
- GPU: A modern card with at least 8GB of VRAM.
- Storage: At least 120GB of free space on a SSD.

# Installation Steps

1. Download and install [Visual C++ 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you have not already.
2. Uninstall Skyrim Special Edition if you already have it installed through Steam. Ensure the game folder is deleted (...Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Editon). Ensure the INI files folder is deleted (...Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition)
3. Download and install Skyrim Special Edition through Steam. It must be installed outside of the "Program Files" folders in your Windows drive, and the game's language must be set to English.
4. Run Skyrim Special Edition through Steam to generate the INI files. Launch the game and click Creations in the main menu, then click O and then select "Download all my owned Creations" to download all the Creations from the paid Anniversary Edition update. Exit the game once finished.
5. Download and install [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) in any location if you haven't already. Click the settings icon in the top right then log in with your Nexus Mods account.
6. In the Wabbajack main menu, click "Browse Modlists", in the dropdown menu in the top right select "Skyrim Special Edition", then click "Show
Unofficial Lists".
7. Click the download button under Ascendance then click the play button. Click the three dots next to "Modlist Installation Location" and select a location to install Ascendance. DO NOT install the modlist in the Wabbajack installation folder OR the Skyrim Special Edition installation folder.
8. Click the start arrow button and let Wabbajack do its thing. If it gives you an error during installation, exit Wabbajack and try installing the list again.
9. Once the installation is completed you can exit, then navigate to your Ascendance installation directory and open "ModOrganizer.exe".
10. Click "Run" in the top right corner. You are now playing Ascendance. Good luck!
