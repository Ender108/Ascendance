## Installation Steps

2. Uninstall Skyrim Special Edition if you already have it installed through Steam or GOG. Ensure the game folder is deleted (...Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Editon). Ensure the INI files folder is deleted (...Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition)
3. Download and install Skyrim Special Edition through Steam or GOG. It must be installed outside of the "Program Files" folders in your Windows drive, and the game's language must be set to English.

6. Download the [Ascendance Wabbajack File](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89515?tab=files) from the Ascendance mod page. Extract it on your desktop.
7. In the Wabbajack main menu, click "Install From Disk". Click the three dots next to Target Modlist and point it to the Ascendacne.wabbajack file on your desktop. Click the three dots in Modlist Installation Location box and create a folder outside of the Wabbajack folder and Program Files folder and name it "Ascendance". Choose said folder for your installation. 
8. Click the start arrow button and let Wabbajack do its thing. If it gives you an error during installation, exit Wabbajack and try installing the list again.
