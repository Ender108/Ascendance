Ascendance is a lightweight difficulty modlist for Skyrim. The goal of Ascendance is to improve gameplay in a challenging yet rewarding way without completely overhauling the core Skyrim experience. Ascendance also includes a noticeable visual upgrade while still maintaining very high performance.

# Requirements
- The latest version (currently 1.6.640 for Steam, 1.6.659 for GOG) of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
- All Creation Club content from the paid Anniversary Edition upgrade.

# Recommended Specs
- CPU: Quad-core processor with high single core performance (3.5GHz or more).
- RAM: 8-16 GB of DDR4 memory.
- GPU: A modern card with at least 6GB of VRAM (ideally 8GB or more).
- Storage: At least 90GB of free space on a SSD.

# Installation Steps

1. Download and install [Visual C++ 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you have not already.
2. Uninstall Skyrim Special Edition if you already have it installed through Steam or GOG. Ensure the game folder is deleted (...Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Editon). Ensure the INI files folder is deleted (...Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition)
3. Download and install Skyrim Special Edition through Steam or GOG. It must be installed outside of the "Program Files" folders in your Windows drive, and the game's language must be set to English.
4. Run Skyrim Special Edition through Steam or GOG to generate the INI files. Exit the launcher once the INI are generated.
5. Download and install [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) in any location if you haven't already. Click the settings icon in the top right then log in with your Nexus Mods account.
6. In the Wabbajack main menu, click "Browse Modlists", in the dropdown menu in the top right select "Skyrim Special Edition", then click "Show
Unofficial Lists".
7. Click the download button under Ascendance then click the play button. Click the three dots next to "Modlist Installation Location" and select a location to install Ascendance. DO NOT install the modlist in the Wabbajack installation folder OR the Skyrim Special Edition installation folder.
8. Click the start arrow button and let Wabbajack do its thing. If it gives you an error during installation, exit Wabbajack and try installing the list again.
9. Once the installation is completed you can exit, then navigate to your Ascendance installation directory and open "ModOrganizer.exe".
10. Click "Run" in the top right corner. You are now playing Ascendance. Good luck!
